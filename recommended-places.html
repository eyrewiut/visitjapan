                <h3 class="subtitle JP">あさくら - ふくい</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Muromachi period, this castle town was the home of the powerful Asakura clan, during the time, the town was the center of the region's cultureal, military and commercial industries and had over 10,000 residents. However, another powerful clan daimyo named Oda Nobunaga burnt down the entire town in his fight to control all of japan. A small section of the town where upper class citizens such as samurai would have lived has been accurately restored and the site has been marked as a historic site. Visitors here can dress up like members of the samurai caste of the time!
