                <p>
                    Hirosaki castle is a historic castle located in the center of Hirosaki and was first built in 1611 by the Tsugaru clan. It is a three story castle tower with fortified moats, castle gates, and some of the original corner turrets remain. The castle's original keep burnt down in 1627 after it was hit by a lightning bolt, when it was rebuilt in 1810, only a three story structure was constructed. It is the only one in the Tohoku region that wasnt rebuilt in the modern era, amongst only a handful of castles in all of Japan. In 2013, it was moved 70 meters using a unique procedure so that renovation works on it's foundation could be carried out and are scheduled to continue for 10 years, however, in 2016, the interior of the main keep was reopened to the public while renovations continue.

                <h3 class="subtitle JP">くらしき - おかやま</h3>
                <p>
                    Kurishiki is a large city with a beautiful historic district in the okayama prefecture and has a pretty canal flowing through, and quite a lot for tourists to do. The canal was built in the edo period (1603-1867) to transport rice and grain as kurashiki's main purpose was as a trade city.
                    <br>
                   Since the historic distric feels more like a completely different town, the many small businesses there work together forming a nice community that makes foreiners feel like a real part of the city. The canal area has frequent boat rides available and lots to do, in addition, there is a highly rated guesthouse called yuurin-an which has traditional style rooms in a original old house, they are very friendly and have a coffee shop on the ground floor that is open to everyone.

                <h3 class="subtitle JP">あさくら - ふくい</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Muromachi period, this castle town was the home of the powerful Asakura clan, during the time, the town was the center of the region's cultureal, military and commercial industries and had over 10,000 residents. However, another powerful clan daimyo named Oda Nobunaga burnt down the entire town in his fight to control all of Japan. A small section of the town where upper class citizens such as samurai would have lived has been accurately restored and the site has been marked as a historic site. Visitors here can dress up like members of the samurai caste of the time!
