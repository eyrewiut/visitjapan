                    Gujo hachiman is a traditional, historic town with much of the town protected as "important preservation buildings", specifically the buildings along <span class="italic">Ote machi,</span> <span class="italic">machi,</span><span class="italic"> Yanagi machi</span> and <span class="italic"> machi.</span> The Gujo Hachiman railway station, built in 1929, has also been designated as an "Important cultural property" and was carefully restored to it's original design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The castle in Gujo Hachiman is also a main tourist attraction in the area as it is known for its view in autumn, the 5 story building originally started construction in 1559 but was destroyed in Japan's attempts to modernise in 1870. It was later rebuilt in 1933 out of wood rather than concrete.

                <p>
                    Another good place to visit in Gujo Hachiman is the Gujo Hachiman Hakurankan Museum which has themed exhibits about the town and information on it's history. There are also Gujo Odori dance workshops and presentations daily at 11 am, 12 p.m., 1 p.m., 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. with extra sessions at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a small street off Shin machi called Yanaka Ko Michi is pedestrian only and is a nice place to relax and people watch. The narrow street is paved with small river pebbles and stones, with a small stream running along one side. A few small willow trees provide shade in the summer.
