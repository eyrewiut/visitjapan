                    Kurashiki's historical canal area is wreathed in traditional style, it's old houses are fascinating to look at however, the houses are still privately lived in, there are some that have been turned into tourist attractions like Ohashi house which is a fascinating ancient house once belonging to the Ohashi merchant family who were the only merchant family influential and wealthy enough to build an internal courtyard in their residence, a feature that was, at the time, reserved strictly for the Samurai class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another similar attraction is the Kurashiki museum of Folkcraft, the museum buildings were originally warehouse buildings which were rennovated shortly before the area was protected as a historic district.

                    Although most of city has traditional parts to it, it is common for these old buildings and structures to have been merged with modern additions, only the "Canal area" has been dedicatedly spared from this and it has become an important part of the city bringing in new tourists all year round.

                <p>
                    The Canals in Kurashiki were built to navigate between the city's storehouses in the early days of the city, the city was once a large and important point on the distribution route of Japans most important commodity; rice. This meant that large quantities of rice and similar products were transported through Kurashiki during the Edo period. Many of the original storehouses remain today and are recognizable by their white walls and black tiles, they have been rennovated into a number of cafes, boutiques, souvenir shops and museums forming the historic quarter.
