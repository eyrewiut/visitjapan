                    The Ichijodani Asakura clan ruins have a fascinating history right up until its burning in the Muromachi period, this period was turbulent time in Japan's history when there was a fierce civil war taking place in Japan, the Asakura clan who built the fortress and town had maintained good relations with the Shogun of the time which eventually led them to come into conflict with Oda Nobunaga who was intent on taking over all of Japan. After Nobunaga successfully took over Kyoto, Shogun Ashikaga asked the Asakura to help him take it back, as a result, nobunaga launched an invasion of the echizen province and subsequently attacked the entire Asakura clan's domain and defeated the Asakaura clan, burning Ichijodani to the ground.

                    Visitors can look around the restored town, dress up as upper class citizens of the time, and read about how daily life was lived there. Unfortunately, only the part of town reserved for upper class citizens has been rebuilt so it is not possible to look around the lords residence or the merchant's and peasents residences but we can still see where they would have been.
