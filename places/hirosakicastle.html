Aside from The castle building, The castle's construction was originally started by ÅŒura Tamenobu during the late sengoku period, this time was a rather turbulant period in Japan's past and after siding with the most powerful leaders he managed to secure the region. However, he died before initial construction was complete and so it was left to the 9th daimyo; Tsugaru Yasuchika.
