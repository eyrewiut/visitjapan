                    With its world renowned technology industry, unique culture, and booming influence, Japan has the 3rd largest economy in the world. The country's influential position in global business is a good reason to get started learning japanese. The japanese language also opens wide doors to a whole new culture, understanding the language is a great way to learn a little more about how other people are living in the eastern world.
                    <br>
                    Japanese is also a great step to learning other asian languages in the future as its similarity to many other asian languages often helps language learners when learning languages like Chinese and Korean.

                    Being an island nation, japan has often been isolated throughout it's history and has therefore been able to develop a unique and fascinating culture that is far from anything in the western world. From samurai warriors and gaisha to the native shinto religion, japanese culture is definatly worth learning about. 
                    <br>
                    Japan is often praised for having a culture that seems to perfectly merge old traditions and values with modern life and ideas. It can do this because of the hundred or so years that it was completely isolated from foreign influence during the edo period, when this period came to an end however, Japan reversed this by encouraging foreign influence from all over the world.

                    Japan is known world round for it's Sushi and Curry but these are only a tiny fraction of the many amazing dishes japan has to offer. Since food is usually very localised in Japan, reasons for traveling in japan frequently include trying the local cuisine!
                    <br>
                    Many restaurants will specialise in a small section of dishes, sometimes having spent generations perfecting it. Restaurants also pay close attention to their dishes from every stage of making it - be it sourcing fresh, local, ingredients or ensuring the dish looks nice for the customer.
